# Road Accident Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of road accidents using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques. The analysis covers:
- Frequency of accidents over time (yearly, monthly, daily, hourly)
- Geographical distribution and accident hotspots
- Accident severity distribution
- Environmental and road conditions
- Vehicle and driver-related insights
- Temporal patterns (weekdays vs. weekends, peak hours)
- Contributing factors to accidents
- Injury and fatality distribution
- Comparative analysis between urban and rural areas
